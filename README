I started hacking this up in the summer but since school started I haven't had
any time to finish it. The engine is somewhat finished but there's no AI yet.
It's designed to hook up with XBoard, but there's a silly command line version
that can be used to help debugging. Heads up, this isn't very functional.

A lot of the code needs to be chopped. Making an engine that understands the
rules of chess is tricky, as it turns out, so there's some ugly code up right
now. Sorry :(. And yes, there are far too many comments.
